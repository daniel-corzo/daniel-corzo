# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Corzo

**Software Architect & Tech Leader | MSc in Software Engineering (Uniandes)**

---

### 🚀 What I actually do day-to-day
- **Building rock-solid architectures:** I design scalable, cloud-native systems (using .NET, AWS, Python and Kubernetes) that can take a punch and scale gracefully.
- **Leading without micromanaging:** I mentor engineers, unblock teams, and help build asynchronous, high-trust cultures across LATAM and the US. 
- **Making AI useful, not just a buzzword:** I integrate LLMs, RAG, and smart workflows to actually speed up development and solve real business problems.
- **Connecting the dots:** I sit right between the C-level vision and the engineering execution, making sure we are building the right thing, the right way.

### 🧠 The human behind the code
I’ve been in the tech industry for over 20 years. I started as a curious, self-taught teenager figuring out code on a borrowed computer, and today I design software while finishing my Master's in Software Engineering at Universidad de los Andes.

I consider myself a **sociotechnical leader**. I love diving deep into technical debt, modernizing legacy systems, and setting up the foundations for products to succeed. But more importantly, I care about the people building them. I build high performing teams based on trust, autonomy and clear goals, not on counting hours or unnecessary meetings.

When I'm not untangling code or mentoring developers, you’ll probably find me traveling the world or playing my guitar.
